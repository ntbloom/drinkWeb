drinkWeb

This web app finds fancy cocktails using a SQL database of bar ingredients.  The ultimate plan is to integrate this with the drinkFinder Python app.
 
This is a student project by a self-taught hobby developer looking to learn html/CSS/Javascript with a Python framework like Flask or Django.

The current iteration of the project features a bare bones template without any functionality.
