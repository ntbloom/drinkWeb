drinkWeb

This web app finds fancy cocktails using a SQL database of bar ingredients.

This is a student project by a self-taught hobby developer looking to learn html/CSS/Javascript through Python and the Flask framework.

The current iteration of the project features a barely working search algorithm and 1990s-era html styling. Hope you enjoy telling me I'm bad at coding as much as I enjoy being a terrible programmer.
